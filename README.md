# Sony-SND-SMT-Replacement
BETA - An implementation of the Sony SND, using SMD parts

# So what is it?
This is a variant of my existing Sony SND replacement, however, it uses purely SMD parts. 
Additionally, it only requires the +5v and +12v rails - there is no requirement to tap -12v from the board. 

**NOTE - This is Completely Untested**
